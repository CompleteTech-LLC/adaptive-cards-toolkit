Overview
--------

The Adaptive Cards Toolkit provides a simplified interface on top of the ``adaptive-cards-py`` library, making it easier for AI agents and developers to create, validate, and deliver adaptive cards. Whether you need to programmatically create cards or want to generate them using natural language, this toolkit offers a comprehensive solution.

Key Features
-----------

- **High-level abstractions**: Create complex cards with minimal code
- **Pre-built templates**: Common patterns for notifications, forms, dashboards, etc.
- **Component factories**: Create elements with sensible defaults
- **Layout helpers**: Build responsive designs easily
- **Data visualization**: Convert structured data (JSON, CSV) to cards
- **Validation**: Check cards before delivery to prevent errors
- **Delivery management**: Send cards to platforms like MS Teams
- **OpenAI integration**: Generate cards using natural language

When to use this toolkit
------------------------

- **For AI agents**: When you need a high-level API to create cards programmatically
- **For developers**: When you want to simplify adaptive card creation and focus on content
- **For applications**: When you need to generate cards from user input or data sources
- **For prototype development**: When you want to quickly experiment with different card designs
