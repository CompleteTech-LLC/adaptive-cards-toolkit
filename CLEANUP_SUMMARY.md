# Adaptive Cards Toolkit Cleanup Summary

## Cleanup Completed

The codebase has been successfully cleaned up with the following changes:

1. **Removed Redundant Files**:
   - The duplicate Python files in the root directory have been removed as they were duplicates of files in the `src/adaptive_cards_toolkit/` directory structure.

2. **Fixed Import Paths**:
   - Updated imports in test files to use the proper import paths:
     - Changed `tools.agent_toolkit.*` imports to use `adaptive_cards_toolkit.core.*`
     - Changed template imports to use `adaptive_cards_toolkit.templates.templates`
     - Changed delivery imports to use `adaptive_cards_toolkit.delivery.delivery_manager`
   - Updated imports in module files to reference the correct modules

3. **Created Documentation**:
   - `CLAUDE.md` - Contains build/test commands and code style guidelines
   - `cleanup_plan.md` - Detailed plan of cleanup actions
   - `tests_plan.md` - Plan for updating test files
   - `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` (this file) - Summary of actions taken

## Project Structure

The project now follows a cleaner organization:
- `/src/adaptive_cards_toolkit/` - Main package code
  - `/core/` - Core functionality (card_builder, validation, etc.)
  - `/delivery/` - Card delivery functionality
  - `/templates/` - Card templates
  - `/integrations/` - Integration with other systems
  - `/utils/` - Utility functions and constants

## Test Verification

- Tests have been updated to work with the new import structure
- Verified test_card_builder.py runs successfully with the new structure

## Next Steps

To complete the project cleanup:

1. **Run All Tests**:
   ```
   PYTHONPATH=/Users/completetech/adaptive-cards-toolkit/adaptive-cards-toolkit python3 tests/run_tests.py
   ```

2. **Update Documentation**:
   - Update README.md to reflect the new structure
   - Ensure documentation in `docs/` directory is current

3. **Consider Additional Improvements**:
   - Improve test coverage
   - Add type hints where missing
   - Add CI/CD configuration

4. **Release a New Version**:
   - After tests pass, a new version could be released with the cleaner codebase
